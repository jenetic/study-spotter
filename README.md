# Study Spotter

⭐️ Google Software Product Sprint 2022

Finding a productive place to study is crucial to student's academic success. However, libraries can often be crowded, coffee shops loud, and the outdoors unpredictable. There is a clear need for an easy and convenient way to find places on campus to study. Our goal is to create a tool that painlessly finds on campus spots to work using crowdsourced data.

We built a web app to store and review study spots in college campuses. This makes it more efficient for students to study and discover new places. This also allows students to voice their opinions, see what others think about a certain location, and find the best study spot for them. 

We used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build the frontend. We used Java (Java servlet architecture) and Google Datastore to store and fetch reviews and different college locations.
